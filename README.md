# AURA Minimalist Apparel

A high-end, minimalist clothing brand landing page built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project is designed to be clean, lightweight, and easy to run locally.

## Features
- **Pure White Aesthetic**: A clean, premium background that puts focus on the products.
- **Responsive Layout**: Seamlessly works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with React 19 and Tailwind CSS.
- **Editorial Design**: Sophisticated typography using *Playfair Display* and *Inter*.

## Step-by-Step Installation

Follow these steps to get the website running on your local machine:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```
This command downloads the necessary tools (like Vite) to run the development server.

### 2. Start the Website
Once the installation is complete, start the local development server by running:
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. View the Site
After running the start command, your terminal will display a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). 
- **Open your browser** and go to that address.
- The website will now be live! Any changes you make to the code will update in the browser automatically.

- `index.tsx`: The entry point that initializes React.
